Replace these files to create your custom lifebars: "lifebar.png", "extrabar.png", "emptybar.png" and "playerbar.png".

NOTE:
• The life bar and extra bar images width needs to be 104 pixels.
• The empty bar (for enemies) image width needs to be equal or more than 105 pixels.

After replacing them you can run the program and click each buttom to cut the images in a lot of pieces.
