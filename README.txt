How to use SORR Lifebar Cutter

First you need four files: "lifebar.png", "extrabar.png" and "emptybar.png". Look at the example files.

The life bar and extra bar images width needs to be 104 pixels.
The empty bar (for enemies) image width needs to be 106 pixels.
The small life bar image width needs to be less than or equal to 50.

Remember, the player's empty bar needs to be a single image that you need to insert in the character's fpg file. Lifebar Cutter doesn't create player's empty bar files.

After everything is ready, start the program and choose an option that you like.
