How to use SORR Lifebar Cutter

First you need four files: "lifebar.png", "extrabar.png" and "emptybar.png". Look at the example files.

The life bar and extra bar images width needs to be 104 pixels.
The empty bar (for enemies) image width needs to be between 105 and 108 pixels.

Remember, the player empty bar needs to be a single image that you need to insert in the character fpg file. Lifebar Cutter doesn't create player empty bar files.

To use "apply palette.bat" you need to do the following steps:
	• Download a program called Irfan View;
	• Do a right click on the batch and click on "edit";
	• Write you irfanview executable directory on the indicated place.
	• Double-click on the batch file.

After everything is ready, start the program and choose an option that you like.
